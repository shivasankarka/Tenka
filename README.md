Tenka is a powerful and user-friendly package manager tailored for the Mojo programming language. The name `Tenka` is derived from the Japanese word `ÁÇπÁÅ´`, meaning "ignition," symbolizing my mission to fuel Mojo's üî• capabilities and your development journey with ease and efficiency.

With Tenka, you can effortlessly search and install from github, and remove Mojo packages in your projects, making your development process smoother and more efficient. 

## Features

- **Create & Remove environments**: Easily create virtual environments to isolate your projects and manage their dependencies and remove them easily. 
- **Activate and deactivate environments**: Switch between different environments to work on different projects without conflicts.
- **Install packages**: Install packages directly into a specific environment, ensuring that your project has the necessary dependencies.
- **Search Packages**: Quickly find the Mojo packages you need from Github.
- **Uninstall Packages**: Cleanly remove unwanted Mojo packages from your projects.

## Long terms goals
- Ability to create and deactivate mojo environments with different mojo versions.
- Better control over package installation from GitHub
