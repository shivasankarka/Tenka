Tenka is a powerful and user-friendly package manager tailored for the Mojo programming language. The name `Tenka` is derived from the Japanese word `ÁÇπÁÅ´`, meaning "ignition," symbolizing my mission to fuel Mojo's üî• capabilities and your development journey with ease and efficiency.

With Tenka, you can effortlessly create, delete environments with different Mojo versions. You can search and install packges from github, and remove Mojo packages from environments, making your development process smoother and more efficient.

- **Search for a package**:
    ```
    tenka search <package_name>
    ```
    This command searches for a package named `<package_name>` on GitHub.

- **Remove a package**:
    ```
    tenka remove <package_name>
    ```
    This command removes the package named `<package_name>`.
    

- **GitHub Project Installation Limitation**: Tenka is unable to install and package GitHub projects that do not have a main package directory with the same name as the repository. For instance, a repository named "xyz" should have a source directory named "xyz" or "src", not "xyzud".
- **Bash Support**: Tenka currently relies on zsh scripts for handling operations and therefore is only compatible with zsh on macOS. If you are interested in contributing to bash development, please open a pull request or issue and get in touch with me.
- **Package dependencies**: Currently, As there are no standard Mojo package versioning system, Tenka lacks the capability to verify if a package will function correctly within a specific Mojo environment.
